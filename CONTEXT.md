Agents docs: https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/llms-full.txt

how can I turn HMREFDocument into cloudflare agents? I want to create a bi-directional parser that turns the benchmark data I have (in markdown format with openapi.json files for the tools) into the datastructures needed to specify the cloudflare agents with tools.

before starting coding, please tell me if this at all can be done with agents, and which datastructres are defined by cloudflare for agents on cloudflare.
