# RFC: Hierarchical Markdown for Recursive Execution Flows (HMREF)

## Abstract

This RFC proposes a standardized markdown format using blockquote nesting to represent hierarchical execution flows in distributed systems, AI agent workflows, and recursive processes. The format enables natural language representation of nested logic gates where workers, agents, or humans can operate as independent microservices within a larger workflow structure. The specification supports both sequential execution and dependency-aware parallel processing while maintaining human readability and markdown compatibility.

## Motivation

### Current Challenges

1. **Workflow Visualization**: Existing workflow formats (YAML, JSON, XML) are machine-readable but lack human intuitive understanding of hierarchical relationships
2. **Real-time Execution Tracking**: No standard exists for streaming hierarchical execution progress in a human-readable format
3. **Agent Coordination**: AI agent systems need a simple way to represent nested tool calls and sub-agent interactions
4. **Microservice Orchestration**: Complex distributed systems require intuitive visualization of service dependencies and execution flows

### Design Goals

- **Human Readable**: Natural language representation that non-technical stakeholders can understand
- **Machine Parseable**: Structured enough for automated processing and execution engines
- **Streaming Compatible**: Supports real-time progress updates and live execution monitoring
- **Dependency Aware**: Represents execution dependencies while allowing parallel processing optimization
- **Tool Agnostic**: Works across different execution engines, AI frameworks, and orchestration systems

## Specification

### Core Syntax

#### Level 0: Root Headers

```markdown
# Primary Workflow Component
```

#### Level N: Nested Components

```markdown
> # Level 1 Component
>
> > # Level 2 Component
> >
> > > # Level 3 Component
```

### Execution Rules

1. **Nesting Constraint**: A deeply nested component cannot execute before its parent component has been initiated.
2. **Execution Order**: Components at the same nesting level can execute in parallel unless dependencies exist. If dependencies aren't known, sequential execution must be guaranteed to be possible. How dependencies are defined is up to the implementation and is not part of this RFC.
3. **Content Streaming**: Component content can be streamed word-by-word while maintaining proper indentation
4. **Line Wrapping**: Content automatically wraps at 80 characters while preserving blockquote structure

### Component Types

#### Workers (Automated Agents)

```markdown
> **service_name** (e.g., document_processor, api_gateway)
```

#### Humans (Manual Tasks)

```markdown
> **role_human** (e.g., legal_review_human, ceo_approval_human)
```

#### Tools/APIs

```markdown
> **GET** api.example.com/endpoint/{pathparam}?query={query}
```

### Status Indicators (Optional)

```markdown
> ‚úÖ **completed**
> üü† **in_progress**  
> ‚ùå **failed**
> üö´ **cancelled**
> ‚è≥ **pending**
```

### Thought Process (Optional)

```markdown
<details>
<summary><strong>Think:</strong> Reasoning behind this step</summary>

Detailed explanation of why this component is necessary and how it fits into the larger workflow.

</details>
```

## Implementation Notes

### Parsing Algorithm

1. Count leading `>` characters to determine nesting level
2. Extract component headers using `# ComponentName` pattern
3. Preserve content indentation by maintaining blockquote depth
4. Support streaming by processing incomplete lines

### Dependency Resolution

- **Explicit Dependencies**: Use natural language or structured annotations
- **Implicit Dependencies**: Derived from nesting structure
- **Parallel Execution**: Same-level components without cross-dependencies

### Engine Requirements

- Stream-compatible text processing
- Blockquote-aware line wrapping at 80 characters
- Support for partial content updates
- Markdown rendering compatibility
