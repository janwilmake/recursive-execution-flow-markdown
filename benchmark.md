Using `RFC.md`, `types.md`, and `parser.ts`, create a dataset of workflow definitions like in the parser. in each step ensure to provide a URL of the tool (we will get the definition from the openapi). use some well known public apis as tools that don't require auth

Give me 5 markdown codeblocks for workflow definitions
https://uithub.com/janwilmake/gists/blob/main/named-codeblocks.md

also give me simplified openapis of the tools used as files {hostname}.openapi.json
